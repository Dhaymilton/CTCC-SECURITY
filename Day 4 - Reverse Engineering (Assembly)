1. What is %RAX and %EAX main purpose?
They are the first return registers for x86-64 and x86

2.What is %RIP and %EIP main purpose?
%RIP/%EIP are the 64 bit and 32 bit instruction pointers that hold the memory address to the next instruction

3. What is %RBP and %EBP main purpose?
A - They are the 64 bit and 32 bit stack base pointers

4.What is %R8 size in bits?
A - 64

5.Which of these registers has a size of 32 bits?
A - %R12D

6.What register does the JE instruction rely upon?
A - 

7. What flag does the JE instruction rely upon?
A - Zero Flag

8.What does the CMP instruction do?
A - Compares 2 values via subtraction

9.Main:
mov r8, 25      ; R8 = 25
push r8         ; Push 25 onto the stack
mov r10, 50     ; R10 = 50
push r10        ; Push 50 onto the stack
pop rax         ; Pop top of stack (50) into RAX

What value is on the top of the stack?
A - 25

10. Main:
mov r8, 25      ; R8 = 25
push r8         ; Stack: [25]
mov r10, 50     ; R10 = 50
push r10        ; Stack: [50, 25]
pop rax         ; RAX = 50, Stack: [25]


What value is in the return register?
 A - 50

11. Main:
mov r9, 5        ; R9 = 5
mov r10, 20      ; R10 = 20
add r10, r9      ; R10 = R10 + R9 → 25
cmp r10, r9      ; Compare 25 with 5 → ZF = 0 (not equal)
je Clean         ; Jump if equal → does NOT jump
mov rax, 14      ; RAX = 14
ret              ; Return 14

What value is returned?

A - 14
