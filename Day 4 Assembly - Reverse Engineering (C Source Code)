1.What does the printf() function do?
It sends formatted output to standard out (E.g. the terminal)

2.What does the fgets() function do?
 A - It reads a line from the specified stream and stores it into a character array

3. What does the strcmp() function do?
A - It compares two strings (character arrays)

4. What is a successful return code for the strcmp() function if the two strings are the same?
A - 0

5. What is main()?
A - It is the designated entry point to a program

6. int main(void){
       int num1 = 77;
       printf("%d",num1);
       return 0;
}
What is num1’s variable type?

A - int

7. int main(void){
       int num1 = 77;
       printf("%d",num1);
       return 0;
}
What is num1’s value?

A - 77

8. int main(void){
       int num1 = 77;
       printf("%d",num1);
       return 0;
}
What value is printed to the terminal upon execution?

A - 77

9. int main(void){
       int num1 = 77;
       printf("%d",num1);
       return 0;
}
What is “%d” in this program?

A -  %d is a format specifier for a signed decimal/integer

10. int main(void){
       int num1 = 77;
       printf("%d",num1);
       return 0;
}
What is important about “return 0”?
 
A - A return code of 0 is generally a clean exit of the program

11. int main(void){
     char *word1 = “word”;
     char *word2 = “words”;
     if(strcmp(word1,word2)==0){
     printf(“same”);
  }
  else{
     printf(“different”);
  }
}
What is returned to stdout when executed?
